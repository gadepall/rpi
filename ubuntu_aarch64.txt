#The following instructions are for  installing a headless ubuntu aarch64 using
#and existing raspbian 

#Download ubuntu 64 bit from the following link
https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi

#Go to the directory where the image is downloaded and extract. You should now have a .img file
tar -xf ubuntu-20.04.raspi.img.xz

#Assuming that you have a usb sdcard reader, find the mount location of your card reader
sudo fdisk -l
#If the location of your usb sdcard is /dev/sdX,
sudo dd bs=4M if=xxxraspbianxxx.img of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync

#Create a temporary mountpoint
cd ˜
mkdir temp

#Remove the usb sdcard and plug in again
sudo fdisk -l

#You should see two partitions
#/dev/sda1
#/dev/sda2

#Mount the first partition
cd ˜
sudo mount /dev/sda1 temp
sudo nano temp/ssh
abcd
#ctrl+X
sudo nano temp/ssh
#Delete abcd
#ctrl+X
#This will create the file called ssh in the first partition

#Mount the second partition
cd ˜
sudo mount /dev/sda2 temp
nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
#Copy/paste the following as it is
#The indenting is important
#replace the ssid and password with your ssid and password inside
#the quotes


#GNU nano 4.8                      /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2

    wifis:
        wlan0:
            optional: true
            access-points:
                "ssid":
                    password: "password"
            dhcp4: true

#ctrl+X
#Now remove the sdcard and plug in to the raspberry pi
#the default username is ubuntu and the default password is ubuntu
#you will be asked to change the password
